**Auto-Econ: An Open-Source Text Algorithm Database for Monetary Policy Research**

* **Details of the public release coming by Fall of 2025**

* **Authors:** Cory Baird*, Vincent P. Marohl†, Moritz Pfeifer‡, Benjamin Treitz§

* **Research Focus:** Addressing key challenges in applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) to monetary policy research
  * Upstream Problem: Transforming raw text into interpretable and structured numerical indicators
  * Downstream Problem: Ensuring valid statistical inference

* **Project Contributions:** Developed an open-source text algorithm database (auto-econ)
  * Enables exploration of various text analysis methods
  * Supports both traditional lexical models and recent Large-Language-Models (LLMs)

* **Methodology:** Comparative analysis of text indicators for U.S. Federal Reserve communications
  * Utilized basic Vector Autoregression (VAR) model, the most common empirical model in monetary policy analysis

* **Key Findings:**
  * Significant variations in model outputs when changing NLP methods
  * Provided best practices for NLP methods in monetary policy contexts
  * Developed guidelines for selecting appropriate NLP tools for different text types and economic analyses
